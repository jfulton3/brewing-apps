A clean fermentation character allows bready, doughy, or grainy wheat flavors to be complemented by hop flavor and bitterness rather than yeast qualities.</td></tr>

The low bitterness leaves the malt as the primary flavor element, and the low hop levels provide very little in the way of balance.</td></tr>

Complex yet well-balanced and refreshing. The malt flavors are complex for a Pilsner-type beer, and the bitterness is strong but clean and without harshness, which gives a rounded impression that enhances drinkability.</td></tr>

Malty with an interesting and complex flavor profile, with variable levels of hopping providing a range of possible interpretations.</td></tr>

Subtle spicy, floral, or herbal hops and restrained bitterness help keep the balance malty but not sweet, which helps make this beer a refreshing, everyday drink.</td></tr>

The hop character is generally more apparent than in other bocks.</td></tr>

Moderately bitter with noticeable malt and hop flavors, the beer is still interesting to drink.</td></tr>

Subdued maltiness throughout leads into a pleasantly well-attenuated and refreshing finish. Freshness makes a huge difference with this beer, as the delicate character can fade quickly with age. Brilliant clarity is characteristic.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>5C</td><td>German Helles Exportbier</td><td>20-30</td><td>4-7</td><td>1.048-1.056</td><td>1.010-1.015</td><td>4.8-6.0%</td><td>A pale, well-balanced, smooth German lager that is slightly stronger than the average beer with a moderate body and a mild, aromatic hop and malt character. </td></tr>

The overall malt impression is soft, elegant, and complex, with a rich aftertaste that is never cloying or heavy.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>6B</td><td>Rauchbier</td><td>20-30</td><td>12-22</td><td>1.050-1.057</td><td>1.012-1.016</td><td>4.8-6.0%</td><td>An elegant, malty German amber lager with a balanced, complementary beechwood smoke character. Toasty-rich malt in aroma and flavor, restrained bitterness, low to high smoke flavor, clean fermentation profile, and an attenuated finish are characteristic.</td></tr>

The malt flavor is clean, bready-rich, and somewhat toasty, with an elegant impression derived from quality base malts and process, not specialty malts and adjuncts.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>7B</td><td>Altbier</td><td>25-50</td><td>11-17</td><td>1.044-1.052</td><td>1.008-1.014</td><td>4.3-5.5%</td><td>A well-balanced, well-attenuated, bitter yet malty, clean, and smooth, amber- to copper-colored German beer. The bitterness is balanced by the malt richness, but the malt intensity and character can range from moderate to high (the bitterness increases with the malt richness).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>7C</td><td>Pale Kellerbier</td><td>20-35</td><td>3-7</td><td>1.045-1.051</td><td>1.008-1.012</td><td>4.7-5.4%</td><td>A young, fresh Helles, so while still a malty, fully-attenuated Pils malt showcase, the hop character (aroma, flavor and bitterness) is more pronounced, and the beer is cloudy, often with some level of diacetyl, and possibly has some green apple and/or other yeast-derived notes. As with the traditional Helles, the Keller version is still a beer intended to be drunk by the liter, so overall it should remain a light, refreshing, easy drinking golden lager.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>7C</td><td>Amber Kellerbier</td><td>25-40</td><td>7-17</td><td>1.048-1.054</td><td>1.012-1.016</td><td>4.8-5.4%</td><td>A young, unfiltered, and unpasteurized beer that is between a Helles and Märzen in color, spicier in the hops with greater attenuation. Interpretations range in color and balance, but remain in the drinkable 4.8% ABV neighborhood. Balance ranges from the dry, spicy and pale-colored interpretations by St. Georgen and Löwenbräu of Buttenheim, to darker and maltier interpretations in the Fränkische Schweiz. This style is above all a method of producing simple drinkable beers for neighbors out of local ingredients to be served fresh. Balance with a focus on drinkability and digestibility is important.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Dark European Lager</td><td>8A</td><td>Munich Dunkel</td><td>18-28</td><td>14-28</td><td>1.048-1.056</td><td>1.010-1.016</td><td>4.5-5.6%</td><td>Characterized by depth, richness and complexity typical of darker Munich malts with the accompanying Maillard products. Deeply bready-toasty, often with chocolate-like flavors in the freshest examples, but never harsh, roasty, or astringent; a decidedly malt-balanced beer, yet still easily drinkable.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>8B</td><td>Schwarzbier</td><td>20-30</td><td>17-30</td><td>1.046-1.052</td><td>1.010-1.016</td><td>4.4-5.4%</td><td>A dark German lager that balances roasted yet smooth malt flavors with moderate hop bitterness. The lighter body, dryness, and lack of a harsh, burnt, or heavy aftertaste helps make this beer quite drinkable.</td></tr>

Even though flavors are concentrated, the alcohol should be smooth and warming, not burning.</td></tr>

Very complex, with multi-layered malt and dark fruit flavors.</td></tr>

Highly carbonated and refreshing, with a creamy, fluffy texture and light finish that encourages drinking.</td></tr>

The malt profile can vary in flavor and intensity, but should never override the overall bitter impression. Drinkability is a critical component of the style </td></tr>

A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer.</td></tr>
